### 1) Getting Started with PyTorch: Training a Neural Network on MNIST

In this notebook, we will train a neural network (1 input layer, 1 hidden layer, 1 output layer) to classify handwritten digits. We use the **Module** as our container from the **torch.nn** module. We'll be training our neural network  on the MNIST, which is the "hello world" of Machine learning and Deep learning algoriths:
