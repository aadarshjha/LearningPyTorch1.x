### 1) Getting Started with PyTorch: Training a Neural Network on MNIST

In this notebook, we will train a neural network (1 input layer, 1 hidden layer, 1 output layer) to classify handwritten digits. We use the **Module** as our container from the **torch.nn** module. We'll be training our neural network  on the MNIST, which is the "hello world" of Machine learning and Deep learning algoriths:

### 2) Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Similar to artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks consist of artificial neurons organized in layers. Convolutional neural networks (convnets or CNNs for short), however, introduced the concept of convolution to automatically extract features that then are fed to a classifier of fully connected neurons.

In this notebook, we build a convolutional neural network from zero and train it on the MNIST dataset.
